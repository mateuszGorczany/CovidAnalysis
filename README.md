# CovidAnalysis

### Environment preparation

User should have had already installed:
- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook

In order to create environment to be used for Jupyter Notebook for *covid.ipynb* file, one has to use execute command:

`conda env create -n <env name> --file req.yml`

or alternatively (using `pip`):
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Data preparation

1. Download data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database/version/3?fbclid=IwAR1lvU3Yo2slo2ds4rzhy9Fws337Efxix-2HbA1cckYzt5fGyUPGELN--yQ)
2. All data have to be located in the same directory as *covid.ipynb* file.
3. Directory with data should be renamed to `Data`.
4. *Data* subdirectory has to contain only 2 subdirectories: *Normal* and *COVID*.

Having done all of the above, one can run script now. 


***More info to be added soon, hopefully***
